Descriptive file names help search engines understand your images:

**Bad:** `IMG_1234.jpg`
**Good:** `sunset-over-ocean-beach.jpg`

Include relevant keywords naturally in file names.

Alt text is crucial for accessibility and SEO:

```html
<img src="sunset.jpg" alt="Beautiful sunset over ocean with orange and pink clouds" />
```

}
```

## Content Strategy
